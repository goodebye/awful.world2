# AWFUL.WORLD ENGINE

this is a very, extremely beta version of the AWE. do the normal node things to run it, and also have a mongod instance running locally or a remote instance on e.g. mlab. check a look at the variables in the magic_numbers.json file to configure the important stuff.

this is distributed using a modified LOL.

# LOL (beta)
the LOL is a license for digital media of any kind that stipulates all digital 'items' are a number and you can't copyright a number so what the fuck 

## modifications
- if ur instance of the AWE gets more famous than mine then i get to be a moderator
- if ur instance of the AWE serves Nefarious Purposes (like a platform for ppl who are filled with evil) i reserve the right to shut it down and hide eggs in your shoes you fucking miscreant (n.b. piracy doesn't count, because digital property is a purely legal construction and i think everything should be released online for free that has ever existed)
